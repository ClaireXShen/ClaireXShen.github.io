      <h2>Design Process Overview</h2>
      <h3>A Little Background Story</h3>
      <p>As the UX research team leader, during regular user interviews, I found that family users of mixed ages (accounting for about 1/3 of the total users) have different adaptability for interface and interaction preferences. Since TV integrated the whole family entertainment, our department manager proposed: Why not develop a child-friendly system, which helps parents look after kids and allow children to use handy.</p>
      <img src="01.png">
      <p>We started our journey by discovering user needs to find out if the idea of developing a child-friendly system is wanted. Later, we defined our users and the features with personas and scenarios and determined the essential features of the minimum viable version with some task flows.</p>
      <p>During the development phase, we produced a wireframe to communicate the interaction design within the team and made an interactive prototype to conduct usability tests and interviews with parents and kids users to dig out more demands. After the evaluation, we worked with programmers to develop our MVP. The WASU Kids was first launched in the summer of 2021, boosting 20% membership payment after launching for a quarter. We investigated the attitude towards WASU Kids from our users and tracked the events to discover the user behaviour on the WASU Kids for further iteration.</p>
      <h2>Discover: Understanding the Background</h2>
      <h3>Review on Resources</h3>
      <p>The idea of WASU Kids is a child-friendly system. The first step in the discovery phase is to review our current resources to determine our ability as well as the limitation of the project. </p>
      <li>Content Resource: age-appropriate and diverse content that caters to children's interests and learning styles at different stages of development.</li>
      <li>Development Issue: excessive reliance on video systems for entertainment can have negative effects on a child's development and well-being due to increased screen time.</li>
      <h3>Literature Review</h3>
      <p>The understanding of industry standards, regulatory requirements, and cultural nuances was mainly based on a literature review, including:</p>
      <li>UX research for children, such as age-appropriate language, engaging visuals, and an intuitive interface.</li>
      <li>Children's development and learning style, focusing on attention and cognitive development, and their use of technology and interaction with digital media.</li>
      <h3>Benchmarking</h3>
      <p>We further reviewed the existing benchmarks, Youtube Kids and Huawei Children, which are currently the most commonly used children's media platforms internationally and domestically, to compare their features, use cases and functions. We found out that these kids' entertainment systems both offer the functions to the class below:</p>
      <div class="inline-list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
      <li>Age-appropriate content and limited search</li>
      <li>Parental control, including screen time</li>
      <li>Improve children' s engagement and watching experience</li>
      </div>
      <p>The following figure demonstrates the comparison of Youtube Kids and Huawei Children: </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="02.png">
        <figcaption>A comparison between Youtube Kids and HUAWEI Children</figcaption>
      </figure>      
      <p>Picks of findings:</p>
      <li>Intuitive design principles enhance children's motivation to explore the system's features. On the other hand, a well-organized layout decreases the complexity and cognitive load when interacting with the interface.</li>
      <div class="inline-list">
      <li>Parents tend to limit their children's screen time:</li>
      </div>
      <p>Opportunity 1. Reasonable time setting for engagement 
         <br>Opportunity 2. Providing feedback at the end of a timer</p>
      <li>Prioritize the needs of parents during role transfers, as the involvement of children in such switching is not typically observed.</li>
      <h3>Short Conlusion</h3>
      <p>By analyzing the current resource, we settled on two key points: prioritizing parents' needs and children-appealing interface. To gain insights in the next step, we will conduct qualitative and quantitative research to ascertain user requirements and related functional solutions.</p>
      <h2>Define: Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Quantitatively & Qualitatively</h3>
      <p>To ascertain whether our product goals align with user expectations, we conducted a questionnaire survey involving 40 parents. Additionally, interviews were conducted with seven parents and three children to gain further insight into user needs within the familial context and the feasibility of integrating these needs into product functions. We have identified several key findings related to essential features and potential solutions based on user research. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the needs of both parents and children.</p>

      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>Three personas have been created based on the interview, which represent three different family types.</p>

        <span class="dots" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span>
      </div> 
      

      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
      <p>According to the user research, we then created several product use scenarios/cases to communicate within the team the requirements and needs of our target users. These brief descriptions vividly illustrate the needed functions and suitable interactions to be designed for specific scenes. We later came up with task flows and function lists based on the scenarios to define the design scope.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="07.png">
        <img src="08.png">
        <figcaption>Scenario and discussions</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <h3>Task Flow</h3>
      <p>Base on the scenarios, we create task flows to communicate the interactions and wireframes. Three tasks were defined to fulfil the core function.</p>
      <li>Task 1: Screen time</li>
      <li>Task 2: User identity verify</li>
      <li>Task 3: Top screen navigation</li>
      <figure>
        <img src="09.png">
        <figcaption>The task flow of screen time</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <h3>Function List</h3>
      <p>According to the task flows, we defined the necessary function for the minimum viable version of WASU Kids, and the functions are located in three portal:</p>
      <p>1. Product introduction 
        <br>2. Kids portal (defined as Kids site)
        <br>3. Parents Portal (defined as Standard site)</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="10.png">

      </figure> 
      <h2>Develop: Ideas & Evaluation</h2>
      <h3>Wireframe for communication</h3>
      <p>Designers created wireframes to communicate with the product manager and development team efficiently. We visualised the functions defined at the previous step with the possible interactions and terminology of user-friendly. At this stage, we discussed the issues based on the wireframes as the following:</p>
      <li>With the product manager: essential/unnecessary/missing functions in the wireframe to be revised.</li>
      <li>With developers: the technological possibility and the feasibility in terms of product development.</li>
      <li>With designers: whether the use of terminologies in the product is user-friendly for target users.</li>
      <figure>
        <img src="11.png">
        <figcaption>Wireframe of the navigation</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <h3>Usability Test</h3>
      <p>The usability test based on the prototype was designed is as follows:</p>
      <p>Task Design—We first list the user tasks, goals, ideal process, and interfaces involved according to the scenario defined earlier.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="12.png">
        <figcaption>Tasks under a scenario</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Semi-structured Interview—The post hoc interview focuses on the observed behaviours during the usability test. Finally, two types of conclusions were presented in our report—Issues on Operation Logic and Future Opportunities. Issues with Operation Logic include problems that cause task failures or multiple attempts. The Future Opportunities are inspired by user habits, including the possibility of synchronizing data on mobile phones, and potential features that would attract target users.</p>
      <h2>Deliver: WASU Kids (MVP)</h2>
      <p>The interface design and programming were conducted simultaneously when the interaction designs were evaluated and optimised. Finally, the WASU Kids is released.</p>
      <h3>First Use Guidance</h3>
      <p>Upon login, users are presented with a comprehensive guide that outlines the fundamental features and operations of the system, making it easier for them to configure their experience. The guide covers essential configurations, such as age-appropriate content, screen time, and parental controls, with clear and detailed instructions.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="13.png">
        <figcaption>WASU Kids guidance</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>The system content is divided into three categories, which simplifies navigation and accommodates the difficulty of operating the remote control with children's fingers. The cartoon entrance is presented intuitively in the character IP dimension, increasing visual interest and appealing to children. Videos of the same theme are grouped together in terms of typesetting, making relevant recommendations more accessible to users. The movie column page offers an immersive interaction that enhances the viewing experience.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="14.png">
        <figcaption>WASU Kids home</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Detail Pages</h3>
      <p>The immersive design of the page is a crucial factor in enhancing the user experience. Capturing and maintaining users' attention improves the utilization rate of the page and encourages users to stay engaged with the content.</p>
      <p>The details page can be accessed directly for broadcast control. This streamlined process not only saves time but also reduces user frustration and enhances the overall user experience. The TV series anthology is designed by revealing the plot on the cover. Users can quickly assess the content and make decisions about whether or not to watch it by the upfront information. Overall, the intuitional design of the system creates a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="15.png">
        <figcaption>WASU Kids detail pages</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Search</h3>
      <p>A search function is an indispensable tool that helps users browse through large amounts of information efficiently. WASU Kids effectively shortens the path from input to output to reduce operation steps. In addition, the association area in the middle partially replaces the input operation, which further optimizes the search process.</p>
      <p>In addition, the search results are displayed in tiles instead of categories, which reduces the information interference caused by the hierarchical structure. This makes it easier for users to find the results they are looking for without having to wade through irrelevant information.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="16.png">
        <figcaption>WASU Kids search</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Follow-up: Evaluation</h2>
      <h3>Analytic Tracking</h3>
      <p>A month since the launch, the general sentiment expressed by users is positive, with many finding the system both innovative and useful. Parents, in particular, seem pleased with the educational content provided and the age-appropriate recommendations offered.</p>
      <p>At the same time, we tracked the user's front-end behavior, the following graphic demonstrates the role switch problem. Many users abandon their attempts to use the search function, assuming it will transition to a standard mode. This confusion likely stems from the search function employing the same interaction in both modes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="17.png">
        <figcaption>Dashboard of WASU Kids</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Therefore, to lower the usage barrier in the next version, we summarised a brief for optimising the design.</p>
      <p><b style="font-weight: bolder;font-style: italic;">Goal: </b> Reduce user confusion about searching in different modes
        <br><b style="font-weight: bolder;font-style: italic;">Tasks: </b> The following two are of the highest priority:</p>
        <div class="inline-list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Employ visual cues to distinguish between the two modes of the dashboard.</li>
        <li>Elevate the prominence of the search feature, perhaps by placing it on the first screen. Given its high usage frequency, it may not be appropriate to assign it the same priority as the dashboard.</li>
        </div>
        <p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Other thoughts on the future design</b>: One possible solution could be to incorporate a clearly visible toggle switch effect that provides users with a clear visual indication of the current mode. Additionally, if users continue to struggle with the role-switch interaction,  the system could perhaps analyze user behavior by relevant data and automatically adjust the content and functions to eliminate the need for manual role-switching.</p>
