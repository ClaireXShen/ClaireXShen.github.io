        <div class="decoration-line"></div>
        <p>When I was an undergraduate student, I conducted a social psychology study that has been published in The Journal of Social Psychology. The study investigates factors that influence social interpersonal trust, including the impact of facial cues and group relations on decision-making. It also sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in trust decision-making. Now as a UX designer with a background in psychology, I shall expound upon how these findings can inform design practices.</p>

      <h2>How do we make trust decisions?</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Trust decisions are a constant feature of our world. Trust has far-reaching effects on our friendships, business dealings, medical treatments, and family connections. There is an old proverb: trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair. So, how do people make trust decisions?</p>
      <p>Picture this: you're at a party, and you're trying to decide which person to approach and strike up a conversation with. You see two people - one with a warm, friendly smile and another with a scowl. Who would you be more likely to trust and start a conversation with?</p>
      <img src="01.png">
      <p>This scenario highlights the powerful impact that faces have on our trust judgments. But did you know that our trust judgments are also influenced by the group membership of the person we're looking at?</p>
      <p>That's what our research set out to explore. We conducted two experiments to see whether group membership (in-group vs. out-group) affects our perceptions of facial trustworthiness and, ultimately, our trust judgments and investment decisions.</p>
      <h3>Experiment I - Facial cue</h3>
      <p>In the party communication story mentioned above, it's possible that people tend to engage with those who appear trustworthy. In fact, people's assessment of trustworthiness can be influenced by the physical features of the face, such as a high-brow bone or narrow cheekbones, which may convey a sense of unscrupulousness.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="02.png">
        <figcaption>Faces with different trustworthy</figcaption>
      </figure>  
      <p>To investigate this, we conducted our first experiment. We recruited 36 participants between the ages of 18 and 25 to take part in a virtual investment game. (within-subject experiment, no interaction between the participants during the trial). In the game, participants were presented with personal information about the simulated friend, such as their gender and photos, and were required to make investment decisions based on this information.</p>
      <p><b style="font-weight: bolder;font-style: italic;">As expected, most participants choose to invest in partners with trustworthy faces. But what do they think of the identity of their partner? Where do they make the decision from?</b> To delve into this matter, we conducted a second experiment.</p>
      <h3>Experiment II - Facial cue vs. Social cue</h3>
      <p>We proceeded to recruit another 40 participants for our next experiment. This time, the virtual investment game was the main activity, but the participants had to complete a dot estimation task beforehand. In this task, multiple black dots would appear randomly on the screen and last for one second, and the participants had to estimate the number of black dots. They had to complete ten sets of this task, which may seem tedious, but we had a buffo planned.</p>
      <p>After completing the dot task, the subjects received feedback from psychology evaluation on their behaviour. They were informed that people tend to either overestimate or underestimate things, and they were classified into either group. This classification was based on their performance in the dot task. In the subsequent investment games, the participants could see not only the partner's photos but also whether the partner belonged to the overestimated or underestimated group. In other words, a sense of group membership emerged. We aimed to investigate whether this would affect their decision-making regarding trust.</p>

        <figcaption>Overview of the study</figcaption>
      </figure>  
      <p>Research has revealed that individuals tend to place more trust in members of their in-group as compared to out-group members. Additionally, the distinction between trustworthy and untrustworthy facial characteristics persists, with a greater impact observed within in-groups. That is, facial trustworthiness appeared to more strongly influence decisions to invest in in-group members than decisions to invest in out-group members.</p>

      <h3>Explanation</h3> 
      <p>From the perspective of cognitive science, trust decisions are normally made by two processes, Type I and Type II. Type I is rapid, automatic, and heuristics-based, requiring minimal cognitive resources. While Type II is deliberate, slower, and requires sufficient cognitive resources for engagement. When making a trust decision, Type I generates an initial judgment, which may be further modified by Type II processes during the processing flow.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="05.png">
        <figcaption>The cognitive process of making trust decisions</figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <p>In this study, the facial cue is processed in a bottom-up manner via Type I, while group membership is processed through Type II. The Type I processes use heuristic facial cues to generate trust decisions, which are subsequently modified by Type II processing, utilizing provided group membership information. Type II processing enhances the processing of facial trustworthiness information for in-group members, leading to a more significant difference in investment between trustworthy and untrustworthy faces. In other words, in-group members' faces are processed more deeply during the encoding and recognition stages than out-group members. Conversely, outgroup faces are processed more superficially.</p>
     <h2>Enlightment</h2>
     <p>In general, we conducted a trust experiment about faces and group membership and discovered that people make trust decisions based on others' appearance as well as the bonds we share. Furthermore, we found that once the group identity of the counterpart was known, the differences in trust between trustworthy faces and untrustworthy faces were more pronounced within their own team.</p>
     <p>As a UX designer, these findings have important implications for <b style="font-weight: bolder;font-style: italic;">how we build trust with users through interface design.</b></p>
     <h3>1.Build in-group feelings</h3>
     <p>There is no doubt that people place more trust in those of their own members. Even for a trivial dot estimating task, given a fake group categorization, people tend to trust in those who share similar traits. Hence, for UX design, it is crucial to take into account the characteristics of the target users and identify factors that can evoke a sense of kinship and resonance. For instance, while creating products for a global user base, it is advisable to incorporate cultural elements that they are familiar with, such as faces can foster a feeling of group identity.</p>
     <p>Taking Jotun China and Dulux China as examples, Jotun has a background image with a western woman, while IKEA has Asian models in their photos, which undoubtedly creates a sense of familiarity and closeness for Chinese users.</p>

    <h3>2.Social proof</h3>
    <p>Social proof is a powerful tool for building trusts, such as customer reviews, testimonials, or ratings can help demonstrate the credibility of our company and the quality of our products or services.In addition, combining social elements with the company introduction make the product look more credible and, at the same time, also establishes an impression of the company as approachable and easy to work with.</p>
    <p>The examples below are the company descriptions page of Sam's and IKEA. Although they both have retail operations and cater to individual and business users, the IKEA profile looks more lively.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="07.png">
      <figcaption>Examples of company introduction with social cues</figcaption>
    </figure> 
    <p>Facial cues also inspire trustworthiness on user profiles or avatars. The research has revealed that facial image affects users' trust judgments. Where avatars are used for customer service conversation if the agent appears trustworthy, with friendly and open expressions that can foster trust between users and encourage collaboration. Here are examples of cartoon avatars from an IKEA agent and authentic avatars from a Taobao agent. The latter one is appealing and warm, making users feel that they are talking to a real person.</p>

    </figure> 
    <h3>3.Be transparent</h3>
    <p>Make sure the interface is straightforward and easy to comprehend, which will demonstrate we have nothing to hide. Use simple and direct language to describe the product or service and provide clear explanations of its functions and what users can anticipate, which increases users' trust and confidence when using the service. Offer comprehensive details about our company, including our mission, values, and background, to help users understand who we are and what we stand for. As an illustration, Apple's website design utilizes a clean layout and prominently sized fonts to convey the company's dedication to education.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="09.png">
      <figcaption>Apple china web design</figcaption>
    </figure> 
    <p>Don't forget to be consistent. Make sure the design is consistent across all pages and elements, such as color schemes, typography, and layout, which help build familiarity and trust with users.</p>
    <h3>4.Be consistent and always testing</h3>
    <p>Research suggests that trust can be increased or decreased when various types of information interact, such as group identity, familiarity and attractiveness. Although facial avatars may appear beneficial, their effectiveness can be compromised if they do not align with the user scenario of the product. Therefore, ensure that the design remains consistent across all pages and elements, such as color schemes, typography, and layout, to enhance familiarity and trust with users.</p>
    <p>After completing the design work, it is crucial not to overlook testing interactions. Interface testing should be conducted to comprehend how people react to and integrate different types of cues while striking a balance between cues that activate cognitive and social motivation.</p>
