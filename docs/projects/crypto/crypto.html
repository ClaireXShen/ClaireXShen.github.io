      <h2>Project background</h2>
      <p>The cryptocurrency industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years, driven by increasing adoption rates and the growing number of individuals and businesses accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. Furthermore, the potential for high returns on cryptocurrency investments has made the crypto market an attractive option for wealth management.</p>
      <p>Our team of financial experts from HKU is dedicated to creating a mutually beneficial relationship between academia and the public. Through cutting-edge research, we provide investors with reliable information and analysis to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Our platform helps novice investors navigate the complexities of the market, enabling them to make sound investment decisions.

      <p>Overall, we believe that our project will serve as a successful example of academia's ability to empower the market and the public, thereby positively impacting the economy and society as a whole. We look forward to continuing our efforts to drive change and create a better future for everyone.</p>
      <img src="01.png">  
      <p>Our journey began with a thorough exploration of the cryptocurrency industry to identify opportunities for connecting academia and the market. Once we had defined our target users, we leveraged personas to identify key features and create task flows. Our team produced wireframes and prototypes throughout the build and launch phases to facilitate communication and collaboration. These tools allowed us to uncover additional demands and refine our final solution, ensuring that it met the needs of our users and exceeded their expectations. We remained committed to delivering a product that would benefit our users and support the growth of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <h2>Learn: Understand the backgrounds</h2>
      <h3>Background research</h3>
      <p>Prior to commencing the design process, I conducted a comprehensive review of relevant information and literature. This enabled me to gain a deep understanding of the current state of the cryptocurrency industry, identify potential opportunities, and propose feasible solutions for interaction design. The industry is currently grappling with several challenges, including high volatility and scalability concerns stemming from a growing number of users and inconsistent regulation.</p>
      <div class="inline-list">
        <li><b style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Volatility. </b> The high volatility of the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to factors such as supply and demand, media coverage, and inconsistent regulation.</li>
        <li><b style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Scalability. </b> With a growing number of people using cryptocurrencies, there is an increasing demand for faster and more efficient transactions directed to new blockchain technologies.</li>
      </div>
      <p>To address these challenges, we have identified opportunities for product development and drawn inspiration for interaction design.</p>
      <div class="inline-list">
        <li><b style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Educational Resources. </b> The growing potential for high returns has made cryptocurrencies attractive for investors seeking alternative investment opportunities. This has resulted in an influx of newcomers to the industry who may not be familiar with the technology and may not fully trust it. In order to address this, educational resources can play a key role in helping users understand the industry, encouraging them to use relevant tools, and building trust in the product.</li>
        <li><b>Growth Potential. </b> Crypto platforms should be optimized for speed and performance while also providing a user-friendly interface for managing assets and transactions.</li>
      </div>
      <p>Our team has carefully reviewed these considerations to ensure that the product we create meets the needs of users and contributes to the growth of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <h3>Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>Once we have thoroughly understood the industry trends, we evaluate existing products to identify our target users and gain insights into their needs. This enables us to deliver a solution that creates value for our users while addressing the demands of the market. Here we chose two exemplary products for analysis.</p>
      <p>Coinbase, a popular platform, stands out for its user-friendly interface and educational resources that are prominently featured in the top navigation. The educational content is beginner-friendly, providing explanations of fundamental concepts such as Bitcoin, decentralization, and Ethereum. Additionally, when reading an article, users can conveniently skip chapters using the secondary title option on the page's right side. However, these features may not be as useful to experienced investors.</p>
      <img src="02.png"> 
      <p>Binance is a sophisticated trading platform catering to investors, providing diverse trading features. Additionally, the platform offers a mobile terminal, enabling users to manage their assets on the go. However, certain intricate features presented on the website may pose a challenge for beginner users.</p>
      <img src="03.png">
      <h3>A little findings</h3>
      <li>Novice investors, particularly those seeking to make informed decisions, require the guidance of experts.</li>
      <li>To minimize user frustration, a concise interface is crucial for beginners, and providing clear guidance can foster trust among users.</li>
      <h2>Build: Define requirements</h2>
      <h3>Product requirements</h3>
      <p>Our team's manager prioritized the educational value of academia and intends to develop a product that caters to the needs of cryptocurrency investors. The product will primarily feature insights into the industry and regulations and offer financial advice that aligns with the investor's objectives. This includes comprehensive market analysis, risk management, investment advice, technology trends and monetary policy insights. This project will establish partnerships with third-party trading platforms to enhance the product's value further. This will enable users to manage their cryptocurrency assets effectively and streamline the investment process.</p>
      <h3>User requirements</h3>
      <p>Given the educational nature of our product, we have identified individuals who stand to benefit from public education as our target users. Through an analysis of existing products, we have created user personas and gained insights into their needs, enabling us to comprehend the challenges faced by our target users, with the objective of pinpointing potential product opportunities.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 3%;">Our target users include individuals who are new to financial management as well as those who have transitioned from the stock market and possess investment experience. By providing academic-based industry advice, we aim to help users make informed decisions and drive growth in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
    <h3>Product structure</h3>
    <p>In the next step, we translated user needs into corresponding product functions and created a product structure that prioritizes key features.</p>

    <h3>Wireframe</h3>
    <p>Wireframes are created to help visualize the functionality and ensure a consistent user experience. In light of the fact that this product is primarily geared towards education and publicity, I have opted for the interface style towards briefing and information bias.</p>

    <h2>Launch: Final solution</h2>
    <h3>Design solution</h3>
    <p>We transform academic literature into widely accessible, general articles and categorize them into various sections based on their respective fields. Users can choose their preferred category from the drop-down selector available in the navigation bar.</p>
    <img src="09.png">
    <p>Once users have selected a specific category, they can access all the articles related to that field. While reading, they can adjust the chapter according to the titles provided.</p>
    <img src="10.png">
    <p>Our products enable users to monitor the current trends of cryptocurrencies in real time and manage their assets through a trading platform provided by our third-party partners. Additionally, we offer a data analysis page that presents relevant interpretation articles, which combine academic insights with market trends.</p>
    <img src="11.png">
    <h3>Component</h3>
    <p>Following the design phase, and given the absence of a previous development cycle within the team, I converted several interface elements into components to streamline future iteration management.</p>
